      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a bit tired of dependencies. Perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s a bit ironic for somebody who does most of his work using javascript frameworks. But after spending yet another chunk of hours trying to upgrade Angular I&amp;rsquo;ve come to think there must be a better way of building software that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve 1000s of node_modules dependencies.
At the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about programming games in Javascript. This isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly a new idea in 2019, but after 10 years of web development I still haven&amp;rsquo;t made a game.</description>
