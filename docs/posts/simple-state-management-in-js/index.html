<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a bit tired of dependencies. Perhaps that&rsquo;s a bit ironic for somebody who does most of his work using javascript frameworks. But after spending yet another chunk of hours trying to upgrade <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> I&rsquo;ve come to think there must be a better way of building software that doesn&rsquo;t involve 1000s of <span class="inlineCode">node_modules</span> dependencies.</p>

<p>At the same time I&rsquo;ve been thinking about programming games in Javascript. This isn&rsquo;t exactly a new idea in 2019, but after 10 years of web development I still haven&rsquo;t made a game. Games are the reason computers were invented, so it makes sense to start creating my own.</p>

<p>A basic component of any software is a state management system. We all know things like <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>, <a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a>, <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">VueX</a> exist and do the job of state management well. But after years of front-end dev and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> work, I&rsquo;m sick of sorting out errors deep within the guts of a framework or the tedium of coming back to a project and needing to upgrade all the dependencies to get started working. So I decided a first step in making games would be to roll my own <a href="https://github.com/tmbritton/state-manager">state management library</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted two things in a state management system, a pubsub component for events and a centralized data store. Also, to completely contradict my opening statement about dependencies, I wrote it in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using it at work recently and I find I really like the autocomplete features it provides to the text editor when you define your types.</p>

<h2 id="pubsub">PubSub</h2>

<p>First I created the <a href="https://github.com/tmbritton/state-manager/blob/master/src/pubsub/PubSub.ts">PubSub module</a>. This is a good &lsquo;ole <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE">IIFE</a> module. I didn&rsquo;t use a class because we don&rsquo;t want multiple instantiations of the PubSub system in a codebase. That would break the functionality. You can see in the link to the code I provided, there are just a few methods. The meat of it are the <span class="inlineCode">publish()</span> and <span class="inlineCode">subscribe()</span> methods. A basic use of this module is in the tests. Yes, I actually tested a personal project!</p>

<pre><code>test(&quot;Publishing an event&quot;, () =&gt; {
    const type = &quot;test&quot;;

    PubSub.subscribe(type, (payload) =&gt; {
        expect(payload.test).toBe(2);
    });

    PubSub.publish(type, {test: 2});
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically you subscribe to an event type, this case the type is &ldquo;test&rdquo;. Then you publish an event of the same type with a payload object. This object is then passed to the callback provided to the subscribe method and it acts on the payload. Simple, right?</p>

<h2 id="store">Store</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tmbritton/state-manager/blob/master/src/store/Store.ts">store module</a> is where the data is held. I did use a class here, but it&rsquo;s debatable whether you&rsquo;d ever want multiple instantiations of the Store in the application. There may be use cases. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The flow here is you call the <span class="inlineCode">commit()</span> function with a type of mutation as the first parameter and a payload for the mutation to act on as the second parameter. The change is then published by the PubSub component.</p>

<h3 id="mutations">Mutations</h3>

<p>I lifted mutations directly from VueX. They are functions you define that accept a payload and make changes to state. You don&rsquo;t change state outside of mutations and you only call mutations via the <span class="inlineCode">commit()</span> function. None of this is strictly enforced since I&rsquo;m making this library for myself. But that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to work.</p>

<h2 id="summation">Summation</h2>

<p>That was a brief introduction on how I put together a simple state management system. I plan to use it in upcoming game projects. It could be used in web development projects as well, but I&rsquo;d probably want to roll my own 2-way binding and virtual dom to go along with it.
